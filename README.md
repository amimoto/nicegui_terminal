# NiceGUI Terminal

WIP and probably should change the name since it'll probably end up getting searched.

Just wanted a terminal element for NiceGUI to hook it to a CLI shell and this is just my efforts in exploring how it works. If you've stumbled upon this, have a look at the `main.py` in the src directory.

Want to help? Hurray! Let me know.
